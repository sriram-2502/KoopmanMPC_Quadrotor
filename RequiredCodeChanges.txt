Completed tasks:
- Multiplication with roataion matrix R (current one is the best)

Priority tasks:
- Reference for MPC (work in progress)
- eval A,B from different intial condition and mutliple trajectories
- tune MPC (work in progress)
- online learning A, B in MPC


Nice to have:
- regularize A,B in Koopman learning
- Force structure on A,B
- Animations for Koopman/MPC
- write the code for 'line' in 'traj_gen.m' (need to update)
- 'for loop' in lsqminnorm for EDMD
